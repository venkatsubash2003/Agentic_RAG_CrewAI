In this exploration, we're tasked with evaluating the mathematical expression: `5*5 + 5*2`. This calculation involves both multiplication and addition, which requires us to apply the order of operations—often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right))—to determine the correct result step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Initial Expression**: The expression given is `5*5 + 5*2`. It consists of two multiplication operations and one addition operation. According to PEMDAS, multiplication must be performed before addition.

2. **First Multiplication**: 
   - We commence with the first multiplication, `5*5`.
   - Calculating this gives us `25`. This result is derived from multiplying 5 by itself, which signifies repeated addition of the number 5, five times (i.e., 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5).

3. **Second Multiplication**:
   - We then proceed to the second multiplication, `5*2`.
   - This calculation yields `10`. This result comes from multiplying 5 by 2, meaning we add the number 5 two times (i.e., 5 + 5).

4. **Addition**:
   - Having obtained the two products, our next step is to add these results together: `25` (from `5*5`) and `10` (from `5*2`).
   - The addition gives us `35`, a straightforward summation of the two numbers.

### Conclusion

By precisely following the order of operations, we glean valuable insight into how mathematical principles guide us from process to solution. The careful adherence to these operational rules ensures that complex equations are simplified into understandable components, thereby avoiding miscalculations. In this case, our meticulous evaluation shows that the result of evaluating the expression `5*5 + 5*2` is unequivocally `35`. This meticulous approach not only provides the correct answer but also underscores the importance of systematic analysis in mathematics.
